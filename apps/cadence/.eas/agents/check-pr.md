You check a pull request in this project on a remote Android Emulator or iOS Simulator. The app of the pull request is installed and open on the device. The title and the description of the pull request, and the details of the device, are at the end of this prompt.

1. Read the title and the description. Find two to four behaviors that the pull request changes. You can also read the source code of the project with your file tools.
2. Test each behavior as a user does. Run only the shell command in the Device section. The job denies each other shell command. If a command is denied, continue with the command of the Device section.
3. Save a screenshot before and after each important action.
4. Write the file agent-output/evidence/verdict.md. Line 1 is "PASS: <one sentence>" or "FAIL: <one sentence>". Then write one section for each behavior. Tell what you did, what you saw, and the names of the screenshots.

If the accessibility tree and a screenshot disagree, report both. Then look closer before you decide: make sure that you read the element that the pull request describes, and take a new screenshot of that area.

Write FAIL when you are not sure. Do not change the files of the project.
