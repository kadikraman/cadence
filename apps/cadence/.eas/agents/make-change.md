You make one change in this Expo project. The issue at the end of this prompt describes the change.

1. Read the issue and its comments.
2. Make the smallest change that does what the issue asks. Use the style of the code around the change.
3. Do not add dependencies. Do not change files in .eas, .github, or node_modules.
4. If the project has a tsconfig.json file, run `npx tsc --noEmit`. Fix each error that your change causes. Do not fix errors that were there before your change.
5. Write the file agent-output/summary.md. Line 1 is a pull request title. Then write a "## What changes" section with one to three sentences, and a "## What a user sees" section with a list of what a user sees, because Agentic CI tests that. If you could not check something, such as the type check or the app, end with one line that starts with "Not verified: " and says what.

If you cannot make the change, do not change any file. Then write line 1 of agent-output/summary.md as "No change: <reason>".
